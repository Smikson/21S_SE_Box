Why are we here?
    To create a program that takes specifications and uses it to make boxes based off of those specifications. 
    To provide the general public with an avenue to design their own beautiful, flawless boxes.
   
What‚Äôs our elevator pitch?
    For woodworkers, Etsy sellers, or just your average Joe
    who need a template for their laser-cut boxes,
    the Wood Wizard
    is an easy-to-use program
    that takes a user‚Äôs specifications and creates the pattern for their custom box.
    Unlike Festi Boxes (the website Dr. Reeves used to cut his example boxes),
    our product constructs a seamless, fault-free template which you can be confident will cut a flawless box.

Who‚Äôs in our neighborhood?
    Maker Lab.
    Client (Dr. Reeves).
    
Present a technical solution.
    Run a Java file that will take input specifications from a console and then output those specifications to an SVG file which can then be imported into 
    Adobe Illustrator so that a laser cutter can cut a box with those specifications.
    
Look at some risks.
    Might not finish in time, might not account for everything the client wants,
    Input that is too large (Box outruns the wood).
    
Size things up.
    Rest of semester. 100%.
    
Be clear on what has to give.
    Completely customizable dimensions.
    
Show our sponsors what this project is really going to take.
    Time, lots of time.
    Four months salary.
