User story 1:
-As a teenager, I want a box so that I can store shoes. 

This box is essentially a shoebox, where the lid is slightly bigger than the body of the box so that it can easily slide on top of it. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most work required, 
this one will be a 5 as we will not have any sort of base to start with. 

User story 2: 
-As a parent, I want a box so that I can have a more unique giftbox for my children. 

This box has an optional lid that is kept on via teeth. The difficulty level is a 3, as we will have the framework from previous designs to build off of. 

User story 3: 
-As someone about to propose, I want a more unique box to hold my the ring. 

This box has a hinge. The difficulty level is a 4, as the hinge system itself will be its own challenge.
